<h1 class="gh">A Global
    Bridal Brand</h1>

<p class="ghp">Lovely Bride was borne of the concept that bridal could be way cooler. When the company was founded in 2009, there was a creative swell of bloggers, photographers, planners, florists and fashion designers doing things differently.  A change was happening in weddings, and brides were looking for something more authentic and REAL for their wedding day.
    So we plucked some of her designers right off of Etsy, and opened a boutique in a West Village townhouse in April 2010. Welcome home Lovely Bride! The sales stylists were fun, not judgey.  The dresses were crafted, not produced.  And the decor was light-hearted, not heavy.  This unique style set the new standard for what bridal shopping could be!
